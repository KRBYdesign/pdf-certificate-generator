# PDF Certificate Generator - PHP

The goal of the project is to create multi-pdf files based off of a CSV of certificate recipients, rather than manually creating multiple PDFs from an editable template within Adobe Acrobat. All of this in PHP because it's the best performing server language I know.

### NOTE: This project has stalled due to limitations with existing PHP/PDF libraries, until I can figure out a work-around or extension.
